## Instructions
1. Slice chicken breast into several long, thin strips.
1. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, hot sauce, paprika, garlic powder and salt. Add chicken and allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes (or up to 24 hours).
1. In a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add the chicken strips. Cook until no longer pink, about 4-5 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, place tortillas on a plate and spread with a thin layer of bleu cheese or ranch dressing. Layer with lettuce, carrots, avocado, and cheese.
1. Arrange a few chicken strips down the center of each tortilla. Wrap tightly, like a burrito. Serve with a side of hot sauce or extra dressing, if desired! Enjoy!
