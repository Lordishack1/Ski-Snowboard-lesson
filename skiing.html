<hr>
<h2 id="necessities">Necessities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Skis</li>
<li>Ski Boots</li>
<li>Proper apparel (ski pants, coat, gloves, lift ticket)</li>
<li>Poles (usually if older than 10)</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="putting-on-the-skis">Putting on the Skis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your boots are properly fastened
<ul>
<li>They shouldn't be too loose as you want your movements to impact the ski, but not so tight as to cut off circulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lay the skis out and locate the tips by the rounded tip and the front binding resembling a plastic mustache</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="file:////u/css/stertzbachif/3695/LinkToPicture" alt="Diagram"></p>
<ul>
<li>Slide the toe of the boot into the plastic mustache</li>
<li>Line up the heel of the boot with the back of the binding</li>
<li>Press until the ski brake retracts and the rear piece resembling a rooster tail clicks upward</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basic-controls">Basic Controls</h2>
<h3 id="beginning-notes">Beginning notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep your weight more forward than backward
<ul>
<li>It's easy to sit down leaning back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stay confident that you can succeed, falling is part of learning</li>
<li>Most rudimentary movements on skis are made with the edge of the ski on the inside of your foot, if you feel that out you will understand your control better</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-stops">Basic Stops</h2>
<ol start="0">
<li>(<em>Optional if using poles</em>) Use the poles to hold yourself steady</li>
<li>Push the backs of your skis outward to form an angle with the tips being the acute side</li>
<li>Make sure the tips of the skis are close, but not touching
<img src="file:////u/css/stertzbachif/3695/link" alt="prepPic"></li>
<li>Unstick your poles from the snow allowing yourself to slide down the hill</li>
<li>Push the backs of the skis out further, while keeping the tips close
<ul>
<li>The wider the gap in the back, the slower you will go, allowing the width in the back to act as your brake</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practicing stopping and going your desired speed until you are confident to slow yourself safely
<ul>
<li><strong>If at any point you feel out of control fall to your side to stop yourself before any collisions occur</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="basic-turns">Basic Turns</h2>
<h3 id="beginning-remarks">Beginning Remarks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pretend that you are pressing a button in your boot with your big toe
<ul>
<li>Applying more pressure to the inside of one foot digging the inside edge of the ski into the snow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's somewhat subtle more of a press rather than a lean, stay balanced</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="file:////u/css/stertzbachif/3695/link" alt="tiltedSki"></p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing with the left foot turns you right, and pressing with the right foot turns you left</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prepare yourself with the previous steps before</li>
<li>When you begin to slide, while doing a wedge with your skis to stop, apply more pressure to the inside of one foot than the other
<ul>
<li>If done correctly you will turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notice how when you press harder on a foot, the sharper you turn
<ul>
<li>When you get good at turning across the hill, notice that you pick up far less speed than going straight down it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="next-steps-beginning-advanced-tips">Next Steps, beginning advanced tips</h2>
<hr>
<h2 id="faqtroubleshooting">FAQ/Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Q: Why am I not stopping?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: Try spreading the backs of the ski farther and make sure your ski tips are close, forming an angle with the skis. The inside edges of the skis should dig into the snow, creating the friction to slow down/stop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: Why am I not turning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: Try applying more pressure to the inside of one foot than the other. Really commit to applying that pressure, and make sure the force is significantly greater than that of the foot not being used to turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: Why do I keep sitting down?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: You keep leaning back, you need to keep your weight forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: This guide is insufficient/inadequate, where can I learn more?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: The internet has many resources, but the best practice is in person. Visit your local ski hill and ask about lessons, most places cater to most skill levels, but it varies.</p>
</li>
