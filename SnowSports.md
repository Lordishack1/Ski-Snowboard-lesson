### Snow sports are very dangerous! Ski/Snowboard at your own risk
## Rules of the mountain
1. Always stay in control and be able to stop or avoid other people or objects.
2. People ahead of you have the right of way. It’s your responsibility to avoid them.
3. Don’t stop where you obstruct a trail or aren’t visible from above.
4. Whenever starting downhill or merging into a trail, look uphill and yield to others.
5. Always use devices to help prevent runaway equipment.
6. Observe all posted signs and warnings. Keep off closed trails and out of closed areas.
7. Prior to using any lift, you must have the knowledge and ability to load, ride, and unload safely.

* Green circle - This is the easiest slope on the mountian 
* Blue square - This is the intermediate slope
* Black diamond - This slope is for experts only
* Double black diamond - This slope is one of the hardest 
* Orange oval - This is a trick park that which could encumber big jumps and rails

Note: Do not attempt a harder slope until you can do the easier slopes comfortably without falling
